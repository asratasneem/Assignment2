# README for Transcriptome Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Respiratory Cells

## Project Overview

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has significant effects on the host transcriptome, particularly in respiratory cells. By comparing transcriptomic profiles between infected and non-infected samples at different time points, we can gain insights into the immune response and pathogenesis of the virus. This project focuses on analyzing miRNA expression levels in cultivated human respiratory cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 versus mock-infected control cells, with samples collected at 24 and 72 hours post-infection.

---

## Goals

1. **Construct Transcriptome Profiles**: Align and quantify RNA-seq reads to the human reference genome.
2. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between:
   - 24 H vs. 72 H time points
   - Mock (control) vs. SARS-CoV-2 infected conditions
3. **Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis**: Discover biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components associated with DEGs to infer potential functional changes in response to infection.

---

## Environment Setup

1. **Connect to HPC**: Log into the Quartz HPC using SSH.
   ```bash
   ssh asrashai@Quartz.uits.iu.edu
   ```

2. **Load Modules and Set Up Conda Environment**:
   Load the Anaconda module and create a dedicated environment for RNA-seq analysis with necessary packages.
   ```bash
   module load miniconda
   conda create -name A2
   conda activate A2
   
   ```

## Project Directory Structure

Organize the project files into a structured directory to simplify data management:
```bash
mkdir -p /N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/{aligned_reads,counts,fastqc_reports,genome,hisat2_index,Raw_data,trimmed_reads}
```

Define paths for each directory (for easy access in scripts):
```bash
DATA_DIR="/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/Raw_data"
TRIM_DIR="/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/trimmed_reads"
ALIGN_DIR="/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/aligned_reads"
COUNTS_DIR="/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/counts"
FASTQC_DIR="/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/fastqc_reports"
GENOME_DIR="/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/genome"
HISAT2_INDEX_DIR="/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/hisat2_index"
```



## Data Download and Quality Control

1. **Download Data**: Use `prefetch` and `fasterq-dump` to download sequencing reads from NCBI’s SRA for each sample (mock and infected).
2. **Quality Control with FastQC**: Evaluate the quality of raw reads to identify potential issues like low-quality bases or adapter contamination.
3. **Aggregate QC Results with MultiQC**: Summarize FastQC reports for all samples in a single report using MultiQC for a comprehensive view.
4. **Read Trimming**: Use Trim Galore to remove adapters and low-quality regions, ensuring high-quality reads for alignment.

```bash
trim_galore --quality 20 --length 30 -o $TRIM_DIR $DATA_DIR/*.fastq
```


These steps ensure that only high-quality reads proceed to alignment, which is crucial for accurate downstream analysis.


## Reference Genome Preparation

1. **Download Reference Genome**: Obtain the human genome (hg38) and annotation files from UCSC or Ensembl.
2. **HISAT2 Indexing**: Index the genome with HISAT2, which optimizes it for fast and accurate read alignment.

---

## Alignment and Quantification

1. **Align Reads with HISAT2**: Use HISAT2 to align the trimmed reads to the hg38 genome, producing SAM files for each sample. SAM files are converted to BAM files (binary format) for efficient storage and processing.
2. **Quantify Gene Expression with FeatureCounts**: Use `featureCounts` to count the reads mapped to each gene, generating a raw gene count matrix. This count matrix serves as the input for differential expression analysis.

The gene_counts.txt file, generated by featureCounts, was transferred to the local system for further analysis.

## Data Transfer to Local Machine

Transfer result files from the HPC to your local machine for further analysis or sharing:
```bash
scp asrashai@Quartz.uits.iu.edu:/N/u/asrashai/Quartz/A2/counts/gene_counts.txt "C:\Users\asra tasneem\OneDrive\Desktop\gene_counts"
```

## Differential Expression Analysis with edgeR

Differential expression analysis identifies genes whose expression levels vary significantly between conditions. We use DESeq2 to compare:

1. **Time Point Comparison (72 H vs. 24 H)**: This analysis reveals genes associated with temporal changes, providing insights into the progression of infection.
2. **Condition Comparison (SARS-CoV-2 vs. Mock)**: This analysis highlights genes influenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealing the host response to viral infection.

### Steps in R:

- **Load Data**: Read in `gene_counts.txt` and `assignment_2_info.csv` (metadata) files.
- **DESeq2 Analysis**: Create a DESeq2 dataset and apply DESeq2 for differential expression analysis.
- **Results Extraction and Filtering**: Extract significant DEGs based on adjusted p-values and log fold change thresholds.

Here's the section formatted as a README entry, focusing on theoretical aspects and key code snippets where essential:

## Differential Expression Analysis with edgeR (Local RStudio Analysis)

After transferring `gene_counts.txt` to the local system, differential expression analysis is performed in R using the **edgeR** package.

### Theory and Steps

1. **Loading Data**  
   Load `gene_counts.txt` (gene counts matrix) and `assignment_2_info.csv` (metadata) files into R.

   ```R
   data <- read.table("gene_counts.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
   sample_info <- read.csv("assignment_2_info.csv", row.names = 1)
   ```

2. **Group and Sample Preparation**  
   Assign samples to experimental groups based on `Condition` (Mock or SARS-CoV-2) and `Time Point` (24H or 72H).

   ```R
   sample_groups <- factor(c(
     rep("Mock_24H", 3), rep("SARS_24H", 3),  # Mock and SARS at 24 hours
     rep("Mock_72H", 3), rep("SARS_72H", 3)   # Mock and SARS at 72 hours
   ))
   ```

3. **Data Normalization**  
   Normalize the data using edgeR’s `calcNormFactors` function, which adjusts for sequencing depth differences. This step ensures accurate comparisons between samples.

   ```R
   library(edgeR)
   dge_obj <- DGEList(counts = data, group = sample_groups)
   dge_obj <- calcNormFactors(dge_obj)
   ```

4. **Experimental Design and Model Fitting**  
   - **Design Matrix**: Defines the experimental comparisons for differential analysis.
   - **Model Fitting**: Fit a generalized linear model (GLM) to the normalized data using edgeR, which models variability in gene expression across groups.

   ```R
   design_matrix <- model.matrix(~0 + sample_groups)
   colnames(design_matrix) <- levels(sample_groups)
   dge_obj <- estimateDisp(dge_obj, design_matrix)
   fit <- glmQLFit(dge_obj, design_matrix)
   ```

5. **Setting Contrasts and DEG Testing**  
   Define contrasts to test specific comparisons:
   - **Condition (SARS-CoV-2 vs. Mock)**: `(SARS_24H + SARS_72H)/2 - (Mock_24H + Mock_72H)/2`
   - **Time Point (72H vs. 24H)**: `(Mock_24H + SARS_24H)/2 - (Mock_72H + SARS_72H)/2`

   Use edgeR’s `glmQLFTest` function to identify DEGs, filtering by adjusted p-value and log fold change.

   ```R
   contrast1 <- makeContrasts(
     (SARS_24H + SARS_72H)/2 - (Mock_24H + Mock_72H)/2, levels = design_matrix
   )
   contrast2 <- makeContrasts(
     (Mock_24H + SARS_24H)/2 - (Mock_72H + SARS_72H)/2, levels = design_matrix
   )

   result1 <- glmQLFTest(fit, contrast = contrast1)
   result2 <- glmQLFTest(fit, contrast = contrast2)

   deg_SARS_vs_Mock <- topTags(result1, n = Inf)$table
   deg_72H_vs_24H <- topTags(result2, n = Inf)$table

   # Save results to CSV
   write.csv(deg_SARS_vs_Mock, "DEG_SARS_vs_Mock.csv", row.names = TRUE)
   write.csv(deg_72H_vs_24H, "DEG_72H_vs_24H.csv", row.names = TRUE)
   ```

   - **Output**: Differential expression results are saved as `DEG_SARS_vs_Mock.csv` and `DEG_72H_vs_24H.csv`, showing genes that are significantly differentially expressed between conditions and time points, respectively.




  
Save the results:
   - `DESeq_results_72H_vs_24H.csv` and `DESeq_results_SARS_vs_Mock.csv`

## Visualization

1. **Volcano Plots**: Visualize the DEGs for each comparison with volcano plots, which plot log2 fold change versus -log10 p-value. These plots help identify significantly up- and down-regulated genes.

Output:
   - `72H_vs_24H_volcanoplot.pdf`
   - `SARS-CoV-2_vs_Mock_volcanoplot.pdf`

---

## GO Enrichment Analysis

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis helps interpret DEGs by identifying enriched biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components.

### Steps:

1. **Convert Gene IDs**: Map significant DEGs to Entrez IDs using ClusterProfiler’s `bitr` function.
2. **Perform GO Enrichment Analysis**: Use the `enrichGO` function in ClusterProfiler to identify enriched GO terms for DEGs.
3. **Visualization**: Generate bar plots to visualize the top  10 enriched GO terms, providing insights into the biological functions associated with DEGs.

Output:
   - `GO_enrichment_1.csv` and `GO_enrichment_2.csv` for enriched terms
   - `GO_enrichment_plots.pdf` for visualized GO results
